# -Automated-Intravenous-Drip-Monitoring-SMART-HEALTHCARE-System
problem statement
In our current medical care system, the monitoring of patients in a hospital throughout the day is a tiresome process. 
 An example of such type of work in our hospital is injecting saline or Intravenous (IV) fluids in to the vein of patient. If the drip system is not monitored on time, it will causes problems like backflow of fluid, blood loss etc. 
In order to reduce the workload and overcome such critical situation in the area of an intravenous drip monitoring system, we will propose a system called Automated Intravenous Drip Monitoring System

ABSTRACT
In Medical field, many devices to introduce a drastic change for monitoring the body measures like blood pressure, heart beat rate, diagnosis of heart attack symptoms and much more automatically with interdisciplinary nature. In this proposed system the IV fluid monitoring system automatically sends a message to the nurse through GSM technology. Our project is aimed to automatically turn off the flow of a liquid from the IV bag by using the solenoid valve. The pulse rate and the blood pressure of the patient is continuously monitored and displayed on the liquid crystal display (LCD). This technology reduces the work of the nurse instead of keep on watching of an IV Fluid system. One of the greatest advantages of our project is the ease interface with users which functionally can be managed by means of mobile application.
